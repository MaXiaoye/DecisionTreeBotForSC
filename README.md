# DecisionTreeBotForSC

This project builds a bot (AI) for Starcraft: Broodwar. The bot is developed based on behaviour tree and decision tree. It uses BWAPI and BWMirror as the API for interacting with Starcraft: Broodwar.\\
SC gameplay can be divided into three key components: micro-management (“micro”), macro-management (“macro”), and overall strategy. Micro is the mechanical control and command of individual units; Macro is the broader strategy of ensuring a player is harvesting enough resources to maintain his army, investing in production facilities and unit upgrades, and building new units to replenish units lost in combat.\\
Overall strategy concerns scouting your opponent, anticipating opponent attacks, planning your own attacks, and choosing which units to build to counter the opponent’s units. This multifaceted skill requirement makes SC the most representative game of human intelligence that AIs have tackled yet.\\	
In this project, Micro\&Macro management are implemented based on behavior tree while overall strategy is decided by decision tree.
